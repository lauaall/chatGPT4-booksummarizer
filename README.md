# chatGPT4-booksummarizer
## **YOU NEED A epub or pdf version of the Book you want to use**
Summarize books and ask AI questions about the books as if you have a person on standby who has read it
You can use this also with a local LLM.
One more thing GPT4 API requests are expensive as fuck so if the book you have is under 4096 tokens use GPT3.5 Turbo its 10 times cheaper
